# lnx-cli-tui-ide

One command sets up a complete, **terminal-centric** development environment on a clean
Debian machine — terminal, editor, file manager, viewers, Git/Docker TUIs, and a fast
prompt — and **adapts to each laptop's hardware** instead of assuming one profile. It
detects the GPU's OpenGL level, available RAM, and network, then installs the best tool
for that machine and falls back automatically when something isn't available.

The philosophy: **live in the terminal.** Edit with micro (and vim), manage files with yazi, read
code with bat, render Markdown with glow, drive Git/Docker with lazygit/lazydocker, view
notebooks with euporie, and multiplex with GNOME Terminal's tabs plus **tmux** for splits.
The desktop is only a fallback.

## 1. Step-by-step: first install

> Run this from a **permanent** directory — the dotfiles are *symlinked from the repo*, so
> if you delete the folder later the symlinks break. `~/.local/share/…` is a good home.

**Step 1 — Clone into a permanent location**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share
git clone https://github.com/mahernandezg/lnx-cli-tui-ide ~/.local/share/lnx-cli-tui-ide
cd ~/.local/share/lnx-cli-tui-ide
```

**Step 2 — (Optional) Configure your SSH alias**
Only if you want the installer to set up an `ssh` alias. Nothing here is
committed — `config.env` is git-ignored.
```bash
cp config.env.example config.env
$EDITOR config.env          # or: nano config.env
```
Fill in your real values (the key path is optional — it's auto-detected from `~/.ssh` if
omitted):
```bash
SSH_ALIAS="myhost"
SSH_HOSTNAME="host.example.com"
SSH_USER="myuser"
#SSH_IDENTITY="$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519"   # optional; auto-detected if left commented
```
If you skip this step, the SSH module is simply skipped — no prompt, no writes.

**Step 3 — Preview what will happen (recommended, changes nothing)**
```bash
./install.sh --dry-run --verbose
```
Read the output: it shows the hardware it detected, which install method each tool will
use, the dotfiles it will symlink, and the exact `~/.bashrc` line it would add.

**Step 4 — Run the real install**
```bash
./install.sh
```
It will ask for your `sudo` password (needed for the `apt`-based steps). Each tool installs
via its best available method; a failing step **logs and continues** instead of aborting.
Cautious? Install in stages: `./install.sh --only viewers`, then `--only terminal`, etc.

> **Trust note:** as *fallbacks*, a few tools may install via their official one-line
> installers — uv (`astral.sh`), starship (`starship.rs`) —
> which pipe a script from the tool's own HTTPS source into a shell. That runs remote code
> from those upstreams; if you'd rather not, install those tools yourself first (they'll be
> detected and skipped) or use `apt` where available. All other downloads are release
> binaries fetched over HTTPS from each project's official GitHub org.

**Step 5 — Open a new terminal**
Reload your shell so the new prompt and `PATH` take effect:
```bash
exec bash        # or just open a new terminal window/tab
```
You should now see the two-line **Starship** prompt.

**Step 6 — Confirm everything works**
```bash
./tests/validate.sh
```
This reports PASS/FAIL for the three things that motivate the whole setup (glow, bat,
euporie). Re-running `./install.sh` any time is safe — it's idempotent.

**Step 7 — Start using your tools.** Each app is launched by typing its command. See
[§3](#3-daily-use--every-tool-explained) for the exact command, what you'll see, and how to
quit each one — for example, open the editor with **`micro`**.

---

## 2. Command-line flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Print exactly what would happen; change nothing. **Always safe to run first.** |
| `--only <module>` | Run only matching module(s). Repeatable. Match by number or name, e.g. `--only terminal`, `--only 45-micro`. |
| `--skip <module>` | Skip matching module(s). Repeatable. |
| `--with-vscodium` | Also install VSCodium (off by default; heavy Electron, emergencies only). |
| `--verbose` | Verbose/debug logging. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage. |

Module names: `00-uv 02-golang 05-ai-agents 10-terminal 15-tmux 20-viewers 30-euporie 40-ruff
45-micro 50-git-docker-tui 60-ssh-alias 70-starship 75-tab-title 80-gnome-terminal-profile
90-vscodium 95-mahg-help 96-mahg-wt`. Every run writes
a timestamped log to `logs/install-<timestamp>.log`.

---

## 3. Daily use — every tool explained

After the install finishes, you use each tool by **typing its command into the terminal and
pressing Enter.** The default editor is **`micro`** (simple, modeless); **`vim`** is there for
heavier work.

### Quick cheat sheet — what to type, and how to quit

| Tool | Type this and press Enter | What happens | How to quit it |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **micro** (editor) | `micro` — or `micro file.py` | opens the editor | `Ctrl+Q` |
| **vim** (heavy editor) | `vim file.py` | opens the editor | `Esc`, type `:q`, Enter |
| **yazi** (files) | `yazi` | opens the file manager | press `q` |
| **euporie** (notebooks) | `euporie notebook file.ipynb` | opens the notebook | press `Ctrl+q` |
| **lazygit** (git) | `lazygit` *(inside a git repo)* | opens the Git UI | press `q` |
| **lazydocker** (docker) | `lazydocker` | opens the Docker UI | press `q` |
| **bat** (read code) | `bat file.py` | prints the file in color | `q` if it scrolls; else nothing |
| **glow** (read Markdown) | `glow README.md` | prints rendered Markdown | `q` if you used `glow -p` |
| **ripgrep** (search) | `rg "text"` | prints matches | (returns on its own) |
| **fzf** (fuzzy pick) | `rg --files \| fzf` | interactive picker | `Esc` to cancel |
| **uv** (Python) | `uv --version`, `uv tool list` | runs a command | (returns on its own) |
| **starship** (prompt) | *(nothing — it's your prompt)* | shows the two-line prompt | — |

> **Golden rule for any full-screen tool (TUI):** if you get stuck, try `q`, then `Esc`,
> then `Ctrl+q`, and as a last resort `Ctrl+c`. One of those exits.

Below, each tool in detail: **what it is**, **why it's here (the advantage)**, and **how to
use it** — including the exact command to start it.

### uv — the Python toolchain · [📖 Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **What:** an extremely fast Python package/tool manager (replaces `pip` + `venv` +
  `pipx`).
- **Advantage:** isolated, reproducible, and fast. This repo uses **uv for all Python** —
  never `venv`. Tools like euporie install in their own sandbox and never pollute a global
  environment.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  uv tool install ruff           # install a CLI tool in isolation
  uv tool list                   # see installed tools
  uv run --with rich python      # ephemeral env with a package, no install
  uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # a project venv, the uv way
  uv self update                 # keep uv current
  ```

### Go — the Go toolchain · [📖 Docs](https://go.dev/doc/)
- **What:** the official **stable Go** (go.dev tarball, not apt's stale build), installed by
  `modules/02-golang.sh` into **`/usr/local/go`**, with **`GOPATH=~/go`** (so `go install` lands
  in `~/go/bin`).
- **Advantage:** a current toolchain for building/running Go projects, the same on native Debian
  and WSL. The module **guarantees PATH**: a managed, idempotent block in `~/.bashrc` adds
  `/usr/local/go/bin` and `~/go/bin` — no manual `export` needed.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  go version                     # confirm (after a new shell / `source ~/.bashrc`)
  go run .                       # build & run the module in the current dir
  go install ./cmd/foo@latest    # installs into ~/go/bin (on PATH)
  ```
  **Update Go:** re-run `./install.sh --only golang` (installs the latest stable), or pin a
  version with `GOLANG_VERSION=go1.26.4 ./install.sh --only golang`.

### Terminal — GNOME Terminal (+ tmux) · [📖 GNOME Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/)
- **What:** the stack uses the system's **GNOME Terminal** (VTE). The installer does **not**
  install or replace a terminal — it only adds the terminal fonts (Nerd Font + DejaVu fallback).
- **Advantage:** native tabs and desktop integration; images and notebook plots render *inline*
  via GNOME Terminal's **sixel** support (that's how euporie and yazi show pictures). Splits and
  persistent sessions come from **tmux**.
- **How:** new tab `Ctrl+Shift+T`, switch tabs `Ctrl+PgUp`/`Ctrl+PgDn`. For splits and sessions,
  see [§5](#5-multiplexing-gnome-terminal-tabs--tmux).

### bat — a better `cat` · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- **What:** `cat` with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a Git change gutter.
- **Advantage:** read code in color without opening an editor; integrates with a pager.
- **How:** (on Debian the binary is `batcat`; the installer adds a `bat` shim)
  ```bash
  bat src/app.ts                 # syntax + line numbers + git gutter
  bat -p file.py                 # plain (no decorations), good for piping
  rg -l TODO | xargs bat         # view every file that matched
  ```

### glow — rendered Markdown · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)
- **What:** a Markdown renderer for the terminal (headings, lists, code blocks, tables).
- **Advantage:** read READMEs and docs *formatted*, without a browser.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  glow README.md                 # render a file
  glow -p README.md              # render in a scrollable pager
  glow .                         # browse all Markdown in this directory
  ```

### yazi — the file manager · [📖 Docs](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/quick-start)
- **What:** a fast (Rust) TUI file manager with image/preview support.
- **Advantage:** navigate, preview (including images via the terminal's sixel support), and do
  bulk file ops far faster than `cd`/`ls`/`mv`.
- **How:** launch with `yazi`. Core keys:
  | Key | Action | Key | Action |
  |-----|--------|-----|--------|
  | `h` `j` `k` `l` | move (parent/down/up/enter) | `y` / `x` / `p` | copy / cut / paste |
  | `Enter` | open | `d` | delete (to trash) |
  | `Space` | toggle selection | `a` / `r` | create / rename |
  | `/` | filter, `s` search | `.` | toggle hidden files |
  | `q` | quit | `~` | help |

### ripgrep (`rg`) — search · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md)
- **What:** a recursive code search tool.
- **Advantage:** extremely fast and respects `.gitignore` by default (no noise from
  `node_modules`).
- **How:**
  ```bash
  rg "useEffect"                 # search recursively
  rg -i todo                     # case-insensitive
  rg -tpy "def main"             # only Python files
  rg -l "ApiError"               # list matching files only
  rg -A3 -B1 "throw new"         # show context lines
  ```

### fzf — fuzzy finder · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage)
- **What:** an interactive fuzzy filter for any list.
- **Advantage:** pick a file/branch/line interactively instead of typing exact names.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  micro "$(rg --files | fzf)"    # fuzzy-pick a file and open it in micro
  git switch "$(git branch --format='%(refname:short)' | fzf)"
  ```
  To get the shell keybindings (`Ctrl-R` history, `Ctrl-T` files, `Alt-C` cd), add this to
  `~/.bashrc`: `eval "$(fzf --bash)"`.

### euporie — Jupyter notebooks in the terminal · [📖 Docs](https://euporie.readthedocs.io/)
- **What:** a TUI for viewing and running `.ipynb` notebooks, with **inline plots** via the
  terminal's graphics protocol (sixel on GNOME Terminal).
- **Advantage:** open notebooks (and see matplotlib figures) without a browser or Jupyter
  server. Installed in isolation via `uv tool`.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  euporie notebook analysis.ipynb   # interactive TUI (run cells, see plots)
  euporie preview analysis.ipynb    # non-interactive dump to the terminal
  euporie console                   # a notebook-style REPL
  ```
  Inside the notebook: `Shift+Enter` runs the selected cell; **quit with `Ctrl+q`.**

### vim — the heavy editor · [📖 Docs](https://www.vim.org/docs.php)
- **What:** the venerable modal editor, for complex/long editing sessions. Used as-is from the
  system (the repo does **not** install or configure it — bring your own `~/.vimrc`). The default
  editor is **micro** (above); vim is for the heavy lifting.
- **Start it:** `vim file.py`. It's **modal**: press **`i`** to insert text, **`Esc`** to go
  back to NORMAL mode.
  - **Save & quit:** `Esc`, then `:wq`, Enter. **Quit without saving:** `Esc`, `:q!`, Enter.
- **Long commands → editor:** with `EDITOR=micro` set (the installer adds it), press
  **`Ctrl-X Ctrl-E`** at the bash prompt to edit a long command in your editor, then save+quit
  to run it.

### micro — quick, modeless editor · [📖 Docs](https://micro-editor.github.io/)
- **What:** a simple terminal editor that behaves like a GUI one — **no modes**. Installed by
  `modules/45-micro.sh` (official latest-stable binary into `~/.local/bin`, apt fallback).
- **Advantage:** the **default editor** (`EDITOR`/`VISUAL=micro`; yazi opens text with it too) —
  *fast* edits with familiar keys: **`Ctrl+S`** save · **`Ctrl+Q`** quit · **`Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V`**
  copy/paste · **`Ctrl+Z`** undo. vim handles the heavy lifting. A tiny QoL config
  (`dotfiles/micro/settings.json`) is linked to `~/.config/micro/`.
- **How:**
  ```bash
  micro file.py        # open (creates the file if missing)
  micro                # scratch buffer
  ```

### lazygit — Git TUI · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- **What:** a full-screen UI for Git.
- **Advantage:** stage hunks, craft commits, manage branches, rebase, and resolve conflicts
  visually — far faster than raw `git` for everyday work.
- **How:** run `lazygit` inside a repo. Common keys: `Space` stage/unstage · `c` commit ·
  `P` push · `p` pull · `b` branch menu · `Enter` to drill into files/hunks · `?` help ·
  **`q` to quit.**

### lazydocker — Docker TUI · [📖 Docs](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)
- **What:** a dashboard for Docker containers, images, volumes, and logs.
- **Advantage:** watch logs, restart containers, prune, and inspect resources without
  memorizing `docker` flags.
- **How:** run `lazydocker` (needs the Docker engine running to be useful). Navigate panels
  with the arrow keys; **`q` to quit.**

### Starship — the prompt · [📖 Docs](https://starship.rs/config/)
- **What:** a fast, informative two-line shell prompt. See [§4](#4-the-starship-prompt).
- **Advantage:** shows directory, Git state, and language versions at a glance, while
  staying fast even in huge repos (tuned timeouts).

### VSCodium — emergency GUI editor (opt-in) · [📖 Docs](https://vscodium.com/)
- **What:** a telemetry-free build of VS Code. **Not installed by default.**
- **Advantage:** a fallback for the rare task that genuinely needs a GUI editor.
- **How:** install with `./install.sh --with-vscodium`, then launch with `codium .`.

## 4. The Starship prompt

A **two-line** prompt: information on line 1, a clean caret on line 2 so your commands
always start at the same place.

```
~/code/web-app  main !2 ?1   v20.11.0   3.12.2
❯ 
```

Line 1 segments (each appears only when relevant):
- **directory** — current path (truncated to the repo root).
- **git branch** + **git status** — branch name and a compact change summary
  (`!` modified, `+` staged, `?` untracked, `⇡`/`⇣` ahead/behind…).
- **language versions** — Node/TypeScript, Python, Rust, and the Docker context, shown only
  in projects that use them.

Line 2 is just the branded caret `⋿⋺` (green on success, red after a failed command; the git
branch uses `⤳`). It's tuned for speed (`command_timeout`, an explicit module list) so it stays
responsive in large repos like a big TypeScript monorepo. Activation is added to `~/.bashrc`
**once**, guarded so it never errors if `starship` isn't installed and never duplicates on re-runs.

> **Fonts:** those caret/branch glyphs (`⤳` U+2933, `⋿⋺` U+22FF/U+22FA) are standard Unicode,
> **not** Nerd-Font icons — the vendored JetBrainsMono Nerd Font doesn't cover them, so they
> render via fontconfig **fallback to DejaVu**. `10-terminal` installs `fonts-dejavu-core` to
> guarantee that coverage (no tofu on a minimal box); the Nerd Font still supplies the tool icons.

---

## 5. Multiplexing: GNOME Terminal tabs + tmux

The terminal is the system's **GNOME Terminal**; use its native **tabs** for quick parallel
shells:

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+T` | new tab |
| `Ctrl+PgUp` / `Ctrl+PgDn` | previous / next tab |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | close tab |

For **splits** and **persistent sessions**, the stack uses **tmux**. Its config is vendored by
this repo (`dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf`, installed by `modules/15-tmux.sh` to
`~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`). It does **not** auto-start — launch it by hand when you want it:

```bash
tmux                  # start (or, reattach to "main": tmux new -A -s main)
```

> **Optional alias.** For a one-keystroke create-or-reattach, add to `~/.bashrc`:
> `alias tm='tmux new -A -s main'`. (Not added automatically — tmux stays manual.)

The config (branded navy, dark only) changes the **prefix to `C-a`** (press `C-a`, then the key):

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `C-a` `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` | build a **layout** from the current pane: `1` two columns · `2` three columns · `3` big-left + two stacked · `4` 2×2 grid |
| `C-a` `\|` | split **vertically** (left/right) |
| `C-a` `-` | split **horizontally** (top/bottom) |
| `C-a` `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` | move between panes (vim directions) |
| `C-a` `H`/`J`/`K`/`L` | resize the pane (hold to repeat) |
| `C-a` `c` | new window | 
| `C-a` `r` | reload the config |
| `C-a` `C-a` | send a literal `C-a` to the shell |

The **mouse is on** (click panes/windows, drag borders to resize), windows count from **1**, and
new splits/windows inherit the current pane's directory. The status bar shows the session name in
brand amber on the left and a compact clock on the right.

> `C-a 1`–`4` are remapped to **layouts** (above), replacing tmux's default "go to window 1–4".
> Switch windows with the **mouse** or **`C-a w`** (window list).

---

## 6. SSH alias — keys & host details stay local

The installer can configure an SSH alias, but **no connection details and no key material
live in this repo**. Host, user, and key path come from a local, git-ignored `config.env`
(created in [Step 2](#1-step-by-step-first-install)).

On install, `modules/60-ssh-alias.sh` reads `config.env`, **auto-detects your key** from
`~/.ssh` if `SSH_IDENTITY` is unset, and writes a managed block to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
# >>> lnx-cli-tui-ide managed block >>>
Host myhost
    HostName host.example.com
    User myuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes
# <<< lnx-cli-tui-ide managed block <<<
```

Then connect via the alias:
```bash
ssh myhost             # uses the managed ~/.ssh/config alias
```

The private key **must already exist locally** at the `SSH_IDENTITY` path (`chmod 600`); if
it's missing the installer warns and still writes the alias. **No SSH keys and no host
details are ever committed to this repo.** If `config.env` doesn't exist, the SSH module is
skipped entirely.

---

## 7. How the fallback engine works

Every tool declares a **primary install method and ordered fallbacks**. The engine
(`lib/fallback.sh`) tries each in turn, in an isolated subshell, logs which path won, and
**continues on failure** instead of aborting. Examples:

- **Terminal — the system GNOME Terminal** is used as-is (not installed/replaced); the module
  only adds the terminal fonts (Nerd Font, with a DejaVu glyph fallback).
- **Release tools** (yazi, ruff, micro, lazygit, lazydocker, Starship): the **latest stable**
  release is resolved at runtime from GitHub — **no pinned versions** — with `apt`/`cargo`
  as fallbacks.
- **Nerd Font:** installed if missing, skipped if present.

Detection facts (Debian version, OpenGL, RAM, network, headless) are gathered once up front;
modules branch on them.

---

## 8. Idempotency, dotfiles & backups

- Re-running detects what's already done and **skips it** — safe to run repeatedly.
- Dotfiles are **symlinked** from `dotfiles/` into `~/.config` (bash-only, no GNU Stow).
- Any pre-existing real config at a target is **backed up** to `<file>.bak.<timestamp>`
  before linking — nothing is silently overwritten.
- Edits to `~/.bashrc` (Starship activation, `EDITOR`/`VISUAL=micro`) live in clearly marked
  `# >>> lnx-cli-tui-ide: … >>>` blocks and are written **once**.

---

## 9. Validation

`tests/validate.sh` (also the last step of `install.sh`) checks the three motivating cases
on the current machine and reports PASS/FAIL per case. It is fully non-interactive and
timeout-guarded, so it can never hang an unattended run.

1. Markdown renders with **glow**.
2. Code shows syntax colors with **bat**.
3. A sample notebook loads in **euporie** and the inline-plot stack works.

```bash
./tests/validate.sh
```

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **`command not found` for a tool you just installed.** Usually the new install dir isn't on
  your `PATH` yet in this shell — **open a new terminal** (or run `exec bash`) and try again.
- **The prompt looks wrong / broken after install.** Your previous `~/.bashrc` is backed up.
  Restore it with `cp ~/.bashrc.bak.<timestamp> ~/.bashrc` and open a new shell.
- **A tool didn't install.** It's non-fatal — check the log at `logs/install-<timestamp>.log`
  for the method that failed, fix the cause (often network), and re-run `./install.sh` (it
  skips what's already done).
- **Offline machine.** Network-based methods are skipped automatically and fall back to
  `apt`/cached paths; the run still completes.
- **`starship: command not found` in a shell.** Harmless — the activation line is guarded;
  it just means starship isn't on `PATH` yet. Re-run the installer or open a new shell after
  `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`.
- **Re-running is always safe.** The installer is idempotent and backs up before changing
  anything.

---

## 11. Development / tests

Run the test suite locally:

```bash
./tests/run.sh
```

It runs:
- **shellcheck** (hard gate when installed) — static analysis of every script.
- **`tests/test_sete.sh`** (hard gate) — a hermetic regression suite for the `set -e`
  abort bug class. It sources `lib/*.sh` with `DRY_RUN=0` under `set -euo pipefail` and
  asserts `log_init`, `run_detection`, and the detection helpers return 0 / degrade safely
  (offline, empty parses) instead of aborting — the failure mode `--dry-run` cannot catch.
  It uses PATH shims (offline `curl`/`wget`, empty `glxinfo`, inert `apt`/`uv`/`npm`), so it
  **downloads and installs nothing** and is fast.
- **`tests/test_pypi.sh`** (hard gate) — a hermetic resilience suite for a **blocked PyPI**
  (the `files.pythonhosted.org` incident). Under a curated PATH and a `curl` shim that blocks
  the PyPI file host while answering the GitHub API, it asserts the closed path is detected
  **fast, before `uv` is ever invoked** (no multi-minute hang), **ruff falls back** to its
  GitHub release binary, **euporie is DEFERRED** (not failed), and the final
  summary is **honest** (exit 2, no false success line). Like `test_sete.sh`, it downloads
  and installs nothing.
- **`tests/test_tab_title.sh`** (hard gate) — a hermetic, mutation-verified suite for the
  tab-title managed block (`modules/75-tab-title.sh`). The module writes a `PROMPT_COMMAND`
  hook to `~/.bashrc` that sets the terminal tab title to the current directory (`~` in
  `$HOME`) on every prompt, inside a marker-guarded block **guaranteed to sit after the
  Starship activation** — otherwise Starship's `PROMPT_COMMAND` rewrite would clobber it.
  Against a throwaway `$HOME` the suite asserts it **preserves foreign `.bashrc` content**
  (one timestamped backup), is **idempotent** (a second run changes nothing and makes no
  second backup), lands **after the Starship block**, **wraps a hand-rolled hook that had no
  markers** (de-duplicated and relocated after Starship), and **reverts only its own block**;
  `--dry-run` changes nothing. It writes to no real file and installs nothing.
- **`tests/test_gnome_profile.sh`** (hard gate, **self-skipping**) — a hermetic,
  mutation-verified suite for the branded **GNOME Terminal "mahg-dark" / "mahg-light" profile
  pair** (`modules/80-gnome-terminal-profile.sh`). All dconf I/O runs inside `dbus-run-session`
  with an isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so the real user database is never touched. It asserts the
  module **creates both profiles** (each minted under a fresh per-machine UUID, added to the
  list, with keys actually written — including `cursor-shape='underline'` — and **mahg-dark set
  as default**), is **idempotent per profile** (a second apply makes no duplicate of either —
  identity is the `visible-name`), takes the **upgrade path** (a box that already has mahg-dark
  gets only the missing mahg-light, leaving the user's manual default untouched), **preserves an
  existing foreign profile** through apply and **reverts only its own two** (resetting the
  default), the pure list helper **dedups and seeds the stock UUID on an unset list**, and
  **`--dry-run` changes nothing**. When `dconf` / `dbus-run-session` are absent — or dconf
  cannot round-trip in this environment — it prints `SKIP` and passes, so it never false-fails
  on a minimal box.

  **Policy — the terminal stays dark, always.** By design the active GNOME Terminal profile is
  **`mahg-dark` in every desktop mode** (dark *and* light): a dark terminal is more legible and
  works better regardless of the desktop's light/dark setting. The module sets `mahg-dark` as the
  default on creation and never flips it; nothing in this repo switches the terminal profile by
  `color-scheme`. `mahg-light` is still **vendored** (`profiles/gnome-terminal/mahg-light.dconf`)
  for reference and for anyone who deliberately wants it — pick it by hand in Terminal →
  *Preferences* — but it is **not** activated automatically.

  **Do NOT auto-switch the terminal by color-scheme.** A `color-scheme` watcher that flips the
  default profile UUID would contradict this policy, so the installer ships none and one is **not
  recommended**. (For the desktop side — GNOME Settings/Nautilus etc. — light/dark still switches;
  that lives in `lnx-gui-ide`. Only the terminal is pinned dark.)
- **`tests/test_tmux.sh`** (hard gate, **self-skipping**) — a mutation-verified suite for the
  vendored tmux config (`dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf`). On a private socket and isolated session it
  loads the config and asserts the Professor's decisions are in effect (**prefix `C-a`**, mouse
  on, `base-index 1`, the brand navy status background `#070b16`, and the `|` / `-` split
  bindings). When `tmux` is absent it prints `SKIP` and passes, so it never false-fails on a
  minimal box.
- **`tests/validate.sh`** (soft) — the three motivating tool checks (glow, bat, euporie);
  it reports skips on a bare machine that doesn't have the tools installed, so it never gates
  the result.

The same shellcheck + `test_sete.sh` + `test_pypi.sh` + `test_tab_title.sh` +
`test_gnome_profile.sh` + `test_statusline.sh` + `test_tmux.sh` run on every push via GitHub
Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## 13. Claude Code status line (tell sessions apart)

Running several **Claude Code** sessions at once (one per repo) is hard to track because the
terminal **tab title is owned by Claude Code** — it sets it to a fixed `"Claude Code"` and there
is **no setting/flag to customize or disable it** today (upstream issues
[#21677](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21677),
[#18326](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18326),
[#55197](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/55197)). So the session identity lives
**in Claude Code's own status line**, not the tab.

This repo vendors a branded status line at **`dotfiles/claude-code/statusline.sh`** that prints,
in mahg colours, the **repo** `[ name ]` (amber), the **current directory** (blue, `~`-abbreviated)
and the **session name** if set — so each window says what it is. It reads Claude Code's JSON on
stdin (`workspace.repo.name`, `workspace.current_dir`, `session_name`), parses with `jq` (or
`python3` as a fallback), and degrades gracefully when a field is absent (e.g. a non-git dir).

**Activate it** — point Claude Code's `statusLine` at the script (in `~/.claude/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/github/mahernandezg/lnx-cli-tui-ide/dotfiles/claude-code/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```
(or symlink it to `~/.claude/statusline.sh` and use that path; or run `/statusline` and point it
at the script). **Name a session** with **`/rename <name>`** so `session_name` shows in the line.
Reopen/`/statusline`-reload to see it. The tab title stays `"Claude Code"` by design — don't rely
on it; the status line is the source of truth.

## 14. AI coding agents (verified & protected)

The Professor's AI coding agents were installed **by hand, outside this repo**, and one
(pi.dev) once vanished with no way to detect or restore it. `modules/05-ai-agents.sh` runs
**early on every install** and makes the repo their guardian — it **verifies** each agent by
its real binary name, **restores** a missing one from its official installer (idempotent,
`--dry-run` aware), and documents where each one's data/login lives.

```bash
./install.sh --only 05      # list each agent + status (PRESENT / restored / DEFERRED)
```

The six agents (use the **real binary name**): **`pi`** (pi.dev), **`codex`** (OpenAI Codex),
**`claude`** (Claude Code), **`agy`** (Antigravity — *not* `antigravity`; Gemini CLI was
discontinued 2026‑06‑18), **`grok`** (xAI), **`copilot`** (GitHub Copilot CLI). Full table of
binaries, installers and data locations: **[`docs/ai-agents.md`](docs/ai-agents.md)**.

> **Protected zone:** the six agent binaries plus `/usr/local/bin` and `~/.local/bin` must
> never be removed by the desktop debloat (which lives in `lnx-gui-ide`). That allowlist is a
> separate GUI task; this CLI module only verifies, restores, and documents.

## 15. `mahg-help` — your environment at a glance

One command prints a **branded cheatsheet of what's installed and configured right now** —
detected dynamically, so it never goes stale. `modules/95-mahg-help.sh` symlinks the vendored
`bin/mahg-help` to `~/.local/bin/mahg-help`.

```bash
mahg-help                 # everything
mahg-help agents          # just the AI agents + versions
mahg-help tools           # just the CLI/TUI tools
mahg-help shortcuts       # the tmux cheatsheet
mahg-help --version
```

Sections: **AI coding agents** (present/absent + version), **CLI/TUI tools** (the installed
ones + version), **tmux shortcuts** (prefix `C-a`, layouts `1`–`4`, splits, panes), **Nautilus
templates** (read from `~/Templates`), and a **config & paths** map (terminal, editors, browser,
prompt, brand palette, repos, agent data locations). Colours degrade to plain text when piped or
under `NO_COLOR`/`--no-color`. *(An interactive TUI launcher is planned for a later version.)*

## 16. WSL: Windows Terminal mahg scheme

On **WSL**, the terminal host is **Windows Terminal** (not GNOME Terminal), which paints its own
colours. To keep both ecosystems identical, the repo vendors the brand scheme at
**`profiles/windows-terminal/mahg-dark.json`** — the same navy/hex values as the GNOME Terminal
`mahg-dark` profile.

- **Manual (robust):** Windows Terminal ▸ Settings ▸ *Open JSON* → paste the scheme into
  `"schemes"`, then set `"colorScheme": "mahg-dark"` and `"cursorShape": "filledBox"` on your
  WSL/Debian profile. Full steps: **[`docs/windows-terminal.md`](docs/windows-terminal.md)**.
- **Optional helper (from WSL):** `mahg-wt-apply` does it for you — `jq`-based, **backs up**
  `settings.json` first, idempotent, and **DEFERS to the manual steps** on any doubt (not WSL,
  no `jq`, file missing/invalid/unexpected). It never risks corrupting Windows' `settings.json`.
  `modules/96-mahg-wt.sh` puts it on `PATH` only under WSL.

  ```bash
  mahg-wt-apply --dry-run     # preview; writes nothing
  mahg-wt-apply               # apply (then restart Windows Terminal)
  ```

The shell layer (Starship, tmux, micro/vim, the agents) is already identical in both ecosystems —
this covers only the Windows Terminal host's colours.

## 17. Publishing: private workshop → clean public snapshot

This repo is the **private workshop** (full history, the internal `.postoffice/` log, personal
email in commit metadata). It is published to a **separate public repo by snapshot** — only the
final clean tree, internal files excluded, a neutral (GitHub noreply) commit identity, and a
minimal snapshot-only history. So the public repo is **clean by construction**, no history rewrite.

```bash
scripts/publish-snapshot.sh --dry-run                       # preview the clean tree + run the gate
scripts/publish-snapshot.sh --publish --message "Snapshot v0.5.0"
```

`scripts/publish-snapshot.sh` builds the tree from `git archive HEAD` (so gitignored files can't
leak), removes the documented internal paths (`.postoffice/`, `docs/security-audit-*`,
`web-ext-artifacts/`), then runs **gitleaks as a pre-publish gate and ABORTS on any finding**.
Full details and the exclusion table: **[`docs/publish-snapshot.md`](docs/publish-snapshot.md)**.
